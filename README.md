  I'm developing a university mobile app for Firat University where students and faculty members can schedule appointments. Students can only schedule appointments with faculty members within their own faculties, while faculty members have the freedom to schedule appointments with anyone across faculties. The app will have separate interfaces for students and faculty members, enforcing authentication and authorization rules. A notification system will remind users of upcoming appointments, and a feedback mechanism will ensure quality interactions
